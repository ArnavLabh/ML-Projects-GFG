[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SAHZ2ILsATYioJwOpe2nb-iaAw5QjrZa)

## Objective
Develop a classification model to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on clinical and lifestyle features.

## Workflow Highlights
- Data sanity checks & outlier handling
- Feature scaling & encoding (categorical to numeric)
- Model comparison (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Class imbalance strategies (SMOTE / class weights)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision/Recall, ROC-AUC
- Interpretability: Feature importance, partial dependence (optional)

## Files
- `4_AI_in_Healthcare_Building_a_Life_Saving_Heart_Disease_Predictor.ipynb` – Complete notebook pipeline

## Extensions
- Calibration plots for probability quality
- SHAP-based risk explanation per patient
- Simple Streamlit / Gradio prediction app

## Outcome
A responsible, interpretable ML workflow showcasing how AI can assist in preliminary risk screening.
