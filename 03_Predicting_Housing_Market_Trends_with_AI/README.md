[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1COyYzwnaOuxPCqNdxM7d0nL3uVDRmHE0)

## Objective
Build predictive models to estimate housing prices and explore macro & micro factors affecting real estate valuation.

## Core Components
- Data preprocessing (missing values, skew correction, encoding)
- Feature engineering (age of property, price per sqft, interaction terms)
- Baseline vs advanced regressors (Linear, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Model evaluation (RMSE/MAE, cross-validation)
- Feature importance & interpretability

## Files
- `3_Predicting_Housing_Market_Trends_with_AI.ipynb` â€“ End-to-end workflow

## Potential Enhancements
- Geospatial analysis / mapping
- SHAP or permutation importance plots
- Ensemble blending for improved accuracy

## Outcome
A reproducible price prediction pipeline highlighting which features drive housing market movement.
