## Objective
Use exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic machine learning to uncover patterns influencing passenger survival on the Titanic.

## Key Techniques
- Data cleaning & feature engineering (titles, family size, cabins)
- Exploratory visual storytelling (survival by class, gender, age bands)
- Handling missing values (median imputation / domain logic)
- Model building (Logistic Regression / Random Forest baseline)

## Files
- `1_Data_Storytelling_Analysing_Survival_on_the_Titanic.ipynb` – Full analysis & modeling notebook
- `dashboard.html` - interactive summary/dashboard

## Quick Start
Open the notebook and run cells top-to-bottom. Adjust feature engineering steps to experiment with model performance.

## Potential Extensions
- Hyperparameter tuning
- SHAP value explanations
- Ensemble stacking

## Outcome
A reproducible workflow showing how narrative-driven EDA improves model insight and communication.
